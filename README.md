# Simple TypeScript REST API
This is a simple project meant to showcase my skills
in building a REST API with TypeScript, and creating a
Docker setup for it.


# Setup
Use `.env.example` to make an env file:
```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Use `docker-compose` to start services:
```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```
